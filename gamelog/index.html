   are:
  
   Didn't realize the allies have a shock target marker. I wish that was on the Alexander leader card!
    I somehow overlooked that on the first turn of the scenario the Germans still have the initiative. I had assumed that the Germans sorry that the allies have the initiative and saw Miss played various cards.

I think I did forts wrong and that's about it.
  
   The last game I played, advanced to hexes nearer toner. I had no success anywhere else. I think you need to get some good die rolls is the allies. Good day rules, and/or good parts and I guess that's obvious. But yeah, otherwise you just roll a bunch of exchanges and yeah, I just sort of end up stuck in the same spot which I guess is what the Italian campaign was actually like.
